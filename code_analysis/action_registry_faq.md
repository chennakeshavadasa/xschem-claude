# Action-registry FAQ

Running Q&A about the input action-registry / binding-table work (branch
`feature/action-registry`). Each entry records the **project state when it was
asked** (branch + HEAD commit + phase), because answers are tied to how much of the
refactor had landed at that moment — a later phase may make an old "no" a "yes."

## Q2. Can a user remap the mouse wheel — **Ctrl+wheel = zoom, plain wheel = vertical pan, Shift+wheel = horizontal pan** — via `.xschemrc` / `--script`? (And why didn't the original author's `replace_key` snippet work?)

- **Asked:** 2026-06-08
- **Project state:** branch `feature/action-registry` @ `bfec8793` (Phase 3a wheel
  fully data-driven; 3b gestures; 3c c4/c5 first key `f`). Wheel dispatch goes
  through the in-C binding table (`xschem bind wheel ...`).

**Answer: Yes — fully supported and verified.** Put these in `~/.xschem/xschemrc`
(or `./.xschemrc`, or a `--script` file):

```tcl
# zoom with Ctrl+wheel
xschem bind wheel up   ctrl canvas view.zoom_in
xschem bind wheel down ctrl canvas view.zoom_out
# vertical pan with plain wheel
xschem bind wheel up   0    canvas view.pan_up
xschem bind wheel down 0    canvas view.pan_down
# Shift+wheel already pans horizontally (view.pan_left / view.pan_right) by default
```

Verified against observable state after firing synthetic wheel events
(`xschem callback .drw 4 <mx> <my> 0 <4|5> 0 <state>`; state 0/1/4 = plain/Shift/Ctrl):

| Input | Result | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| plain wheel | `zoom` unchanged, `yorigin` moves | vertical pan ✅ |
| Ctrl+wheel  | `zoom` changes                   | zoom ✅ |
| Shift+wheel | `zoom` unchanged, `xorigin` moves | horizontal pan ✅ |

`xschem bindings dump` reflects the swap. (Swap `up`↔`down` for the opposite scroll
direction.) Timing is safe: `xschem bind` calls `ensure_input_bindings()`, which
lazily seeds the defaults *then* applies the override; `init_input_bindings()` is
guarded by `input_bindings_initialized`, so it never re-runs and clobbers the user's
rows — order of `.xschemrc` vs GUI bring-up does not matter.

**Why the original author's `replace_key` snippet didn't work.** `replace_key` is a
separate, *older, Tcl/Tk-level* mechanism (`set_replace_key_binding` →
`key_binding`, xschem.tcl:10994/1121). It installs a more-specific Tk binding such
as `<Control-Button-4>` that re-emits an `xschem callback` with a **rewritten
modifier mask** (e.g. mapping `Control-Button-4` → the state of a plain
`ButtonPress-4`), tricking the C wheel handler into seeing a different chord. It is
fragile in ways that bite silently:

- **Tk 8.7 / 9.0 deliver the wheel as `<MouseWheel>`, not `<Button-4/5>`**
  (xschem.tcl:9981 only binds `<MouseWheel>` when `tclversion > 8.7`). On those
  builds the `<Control-Button-4>` overrides never fire — the physical event isn't a
  Button-4 event. **Most likely cause of the failure.**
- Depends on Tk binding-specificity and on which widget (`.drw` vs the toplevel) the
  generic `<ButtonPress>` (xschem.tcl:9996/9998) vs the `replace_key` binding land
  on — subtle, easy to get subtly wrong.
- Piggybacks on the C button-mask stripping (`callback.c:4507`) as an undocumented
  implementation detail.

**Why the binding table is robust instead.** It dispatches **in C, after** the
event is normalized to "wheel up/down + clean modifier mask" — independent of Tk
version or how Tk delivered the event. It is the intended replacement for
`replace_key` for wheel/button/(now) key remapping.

**Caveats.**
1. Over a waveform graph, plain/Shift wheel still routes to the graph
   (`graph.forward` over_graph rows, unchanged); the canvas rebind only affects
   bare-canvas wheeling. Ctrl+wheel stays canvas-zoom even over a graph (its branch
   in `handle_mouse_wheel` forces `ctx=ACTX_CANVAS`).
2. Keep `graph_use_ctrl_key` at its default `0`. Setting it `1` reserves Ctrl+wheel
   for graph interaction, and `handle_mouse_wheel` returns early for Ctrl — so the
   canvas zoom binding won't be reached.

## Q1. Can a user remap the zoom-rectangle gesture from RMB-drag to **Ctrl+RMB-drag** with the current code?

- **Asked:** 2026-06-08
- **Project state:** branch `feature/action-registry` @ `898639af` (Phase 3a/3b done,
  Phase 3c c4/c5 first batch — key `f` — done). Mouse buttons: only the *bare*
  Button3 zoom-rect chord is data-driven (Phase 3b).

**Answer: No — not with the code at that commit, even though the binding can be created.**

`xschem bind button 3 ctrl canvas view.zoom_rect` parses and stores a valid row
(`parse_mods("ctrl") → ControlMask`, code 3). But the **press handler never reaches
the table dispatcher for a *modified* Button3 chord.**

`handle_button_press` (`callback.c`) is an `if / else-if` chain, and the data-driven
`dispatch_button_chord()` sits at the *end* of it (`callback.c:4560`). Earlier
`if`/`else if` branches hardcode the modified-Button3 chords and match first:

```c
if     (!excl && button==Button3 && state==ControlMask && semaphore<2) { … select_connected_nets(1); }  // 4522 ← Ctrl+RMB caught HERE
else if(!excl && button==Button3 && EQUAL_MODMASK && …)                { break_wires_at_point(…); }       // 4530/4536  (Alt+RMB)
else if(!excl && button==Button3 && state==ShiftMask && …)             { select_connected_nets(0); }      // 4542  (Shift+RMB)
…
else if(!excl && semaphore<2 && dispatch_button_chord(button, state, mx, my)) return;                      // 4560 ← table only reached here
```

`state` *is* correctly button-mask-stripped at `callback.c:4507`, so
`dispatch_button_chord` would see `mods==ControlMask` and *could* match the row — but
it is never called for Ctrl+Button3 because the hardcoded branch at 4522 wins and the
dispatch is in a later `else if`. Only **bare** Button3 falls through (the plain-RMB
context menu was moved to the release path, freeing the no-modifier slot).

**The completion side is already ready.** On Ctrl+RMB *release*, `state ==
Button3Mask|ControlMask`, so the exact-match context-menu branch
`if(state == Button3Mask)` (`callback.c:4779`) is skipped and the Phase 3b
fallthrough `else if((ui_state & STARTZOOM) && semaphore<2) end_place_move_copy_zoom()`
(`callback.c:4789`) completes the gesture. So only the **initiation** is blocked.

**What it would take** (a natural Phase 3 follow-on, same pattern as the key work):
1. Extract the hardcoded modified-Button3 branches into `act_*` fns
   (`select_connected_nets`, `break_wires_at_point`) + `{button 3 ctrl/shift/alt
   canvas}` rows; **or**
2. Move `dispatch_button_chord` earlier so a user-bound chord pre-empts the hardcoded
   default ("table-first, hardcoded-fallthrough" precedence, like the keys now have).

**UX consequence:** Ctrl+RMB is already a feature (select instance + connected nets,
stopping at junctions), so rebinding it to zoom means relocating that feature to
another chord.
