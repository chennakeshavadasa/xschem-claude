# Empirical probe: net-as-object, the c2 handle (stable-object-handles step-3
# direction (c)). Demonstrates that a net — which is DERIVED, with no struct and
# no id of its own — can be held across edits by anchoring on a stored-object
# handle (a wire_id / instance_id, stable from steps 1-2). Re-runs the §2c
# coherence scenario side-by-side with the handle version. Output:
# /tmp/net_probe7.log.

### 1. resolve the net three ways: by wire anchor, by instance pin, by name

### 2. enumerate distinct nets, and just the selection's nets

xschem unselect_all; xschem select wire 0
p {nets -selected  (COLD — rebuilds sel_array, unlike resolved_net)} {
