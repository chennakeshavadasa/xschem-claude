# Characterization tests for the GRAPHICAL object lifecycle (rect/line/poly/arc)
# — Phase A of the stable-object-handles step-3 work. These lock the CURRENT
# behavior as observed through the Tcl surface, so the upcoming lifecycle funnel
# refactor (route every per-layer rects/lines/polygons/arcs ++/--/= through one
# family in store.c) is provably behavior-identical. They must be green at every
# commit from Phase A on.
#
# Sourced by gfx_wrap.tcl, which provides `check`, `xcheck`, `::qo_dir`.
#
# THE NEW WRINKLE vs wires/instances: graphical objects live in PER-LAYER arrays
# (xctx->rect[layer][index], count xctx->rects[layer]). An object is addressed by
# the pair (layer, index), and that pair is what `xschem selection` returns as
# {type index col id} with col == the layer. There is no name and (today) no id,
# so a held (layer,index) dangles silently across a delete — the §2e hazard with
# no handle at all. That is exactly what Phase D will cure.
#
# Lifecycle sites exercised (census in code_analysis/graphical_lifecycle_census.md):
#   BIRTH store fns   -> GC2  (xschem rect/line/polygon/arc ...)   [store.c]
#   BIRTH merge fns   -> GC13 (xschem copy + paste)                [paste.c]

#   undo restore (both backends) -> GC4 / GC12
# NOT covered (honest gaps, per green-but-hollow rule 4):
#   DEATH check_collapsing_objects (degenerate cleanup, move.c:133) — only fires
#   after a move/copy that makes a rect zero-area or a line zero-length; not
#   cleanly reachable as an isolated op from Tcl. The Phase C funnel routes it
#   through the same death door, covered structurally by the byte-compare drift
#   check (GC12) over move-bearing cycles, not directly here.

### different rect. This is what Phase D cures with an id.

### GH1–GH11 — session-stable graphical-object ids (Phase D of the step-3 plan).
### Committed RED first per the TDD discipline: every xcheck below logs XFAIL
### until the D2 implementation lands, then flips to a plain check. GH7 (disk
### undo = invalidate-on-restore) flips to a HARD check too, like the instance
### HI7 — the disk-undo contract is already settled for the whole effort.
###
### Surface under test (additive, per-type, two scheduler subcommands each;
### the index is the per-layer PAIR {layer index} because graphical objects
### live in per-layer arrays):
###   xschem <type>_id <layer> <index>  → session-stable id (or -1)
###   xschem <type>_index <id>          → {layer index} (or -1)
### for <type> in rect line poly arc. One SHARED id space across all four
### types (a rect and a line never collide on id value).
###
### Conventions: wrappers h_gid/h_gidx (defined in the helpers section above)
### catch the "invalid command" error so the RED suite runs to completion (-2
### sentinel, transparent once the commands exist). The id is the ONLY handle
### (graphical types have no name).
