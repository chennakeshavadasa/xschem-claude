# Characterization tests for the GRAPHICAL object lifecycle (rect/line/poly/arc)
# — Phase A of the stable-object-handles step-3 work. These lock the CURRENT
# behavior as observed through the Tcl surface, so the upcoming lifecycle funnel
# refactor (route every per-layer rects/lines/polygons/arcs ++/--/= through one
# family in store.c) is provably behavior-identical. They must be green at every
# commit from Phase A on.
#
# Sourced by gfx_wrap.tcl, which provides `check`, `xcheck`, `::qo_dir`.
#
# THE NEW WRINKLE vs wires/instances: graphical objects live in PER-LAYER arrays
# (xctx->rect[layer][index], count xctx->rects[layer]). An object is addressed by
# the pair (layer, index), and that pair is what `xschem selection` returns as
# {type index col id} with col == the layer. There is no name and (today) no id,
# so a held (layer,index) dangles silently across a delete — the §2e hazard with
# no handle at all. That is exactly what Phase D will cure.
#
# Lifecycle sites exercised (census in code_analysis/graphical_lifecycle_census.md):
#   BIRTH store fns   -> GC2  (xschem rect/line/polygon/arc ...)   [store.c]
#   BIRTH merge fns   -> GC13 (xschem copy + paste)                [paste.c]
#   BIRTH load fns    -> every reload                              [save.c]
#   DEATH delete      -> GC3 / GC5                                 [select.c:399-488]
#   REORDER-SHIFT pos>=0 insert -> GC9 (rect/line only, Tcl-reachable) [store.c]
#   REORDER-SWAP  change_elem_order -> GC8                         [editprop.c:1104]
#   BULK_RESET clear  -> GC10                                      [actions.c:1096]
#   undo restore (both backends) -> GC4 / GC12
# NOT covered (honest gaps, per green-but-hollow rule 4):
#   DEATH check_collapsing_objects (degenerate cleanup, move.c:133) — only fires
#   after a move/copy that makes a rect zero-area or a line zero-length; not
#   cleanly reachable as an isolated op from Tcl. The Phase C funnel routes it
#   through the same death door, covered structurally by the byte-compare drift
#   check (GC12) over move-bearing cycles, not directly here.

### GC4 — undo/redo round-trip of a DELETE (the undoable op), BOTH backends.
### NOTE: programmatic graphical create (`xschem rect ...`) does NOT push undo
### (unlike `xschem instance`), so the undoable cycle is delete->undo, not
### create->undo; GC4e locks that asymmetry explicitly.

### GC4e — programmatic graphical create is NOT undoable (the rect/line/polygon/
### arc scheduler commands do not call push_undo): undoing right after a create
### does not remove it. A real, surprising behavior worth locking before the

### GC5 — THE per-layer index dangle (the §2e analog, the whole motivation).
### Locks today's behavior: a rect's array INDEX is unstable across a delete of
### an EARLIER rect on the same layer (compaction shifts it down), and there is
### NO name and NO id to fall back on — the held (layer,index) silently names a
### different rect. This is what Phase D cures with an id.
