# Characterization tests (Phase A of plan_stable_handles_step1.md).
# These lock the CURRENT wire lifecycle behavior as observed through the Tcl
# surface, so the Phase C funnel refactor is provably behavior-identical.
# They must be green at every commit from Phase A on.
#
# Sourced by wrap.tcl, which provides `check`, `xcheck` and `::qo_dir`.
#
# Conventions:
# - All edits happen on /tmp/sh_fixture.sch (a copy) — never the repo file.
# - `xschem set modified 0` before every load (avoids the save-prompt modal).
# - Wire snapshots are COORDINATE-ONLY and SORTED: the set of wires is the
#   behavior we preserve; array order is an implementation detail that is
#   already unstable today (see tcl_introspection_wire.md §2e) and that the
#   funnel must remain free to change. Attribute drift is covered separately
#   by the byte-compare checks (CH5), because wire lab= attrs are stamped by
#   the connectivity engine and would produce false snapshot diffs.
