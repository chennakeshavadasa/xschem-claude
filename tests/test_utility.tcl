# them through a bounded xargs pool instead of a sequential foreach. Each job is a
# self-contained /bin/sh command string so that any `cd` and redirection stays
# isolated to the child process (the Tcl interpreter's cwd is never touched), and
# each job writes only into a private work dir so concurrent writers never collide.

# Number of parallel jobs: all online CPUs minus 4 (leave headroom for an
# interactive machine), with a hard floor of 1. No user-facing knob by design.
