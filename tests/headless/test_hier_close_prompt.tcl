# B9 (deep-hierarchy edge audit, pulled forward): closing/quitting while descended
# must account for unsaved edits in ANCESTOR hierarchy levels, not just the current
# level. Spec: specs/descend_hierarchy_in_memory.md
#
# Background: B5/B6 let you descend past an unsaved parent (its edits live in
# cellName~.sch). xctx->modified only reflects the CURRENT level, so a deep
# close/quit that checks it alone would not prompt though the design has unsaved
# work. hierarchy_modified() is true if the current level is modified OR any
# ancestor on the descend stack still has a ~ backup. The exit/close prompt uses it.
#
# This test pins the detection logic (the prompt wiring itself is GUI-only:
# tk_messageBox under has_x). Run TRUE HEADLESS from the repo root:
#   src/xschem --nogui --pipe -q --nolog --script tests/headless/test_hier_close_prompt.tcl
