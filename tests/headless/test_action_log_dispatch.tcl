# Action-log Phase 1, Layer A first slice: Tcl-backed actions dispatched through
# the binding table (dispatch_input_action, callback.c) are recorded in the
# action log -- the canonical d->tcl command verbatim on success, a
# '# failed: <cmd>' comment on error (recorded AFTER evaluation, same rule as
# CIW-typed commands, so the file stays source-able). C-backed actions are NOT
# logged yet (that is the next slice -- needs the canonical command surfaced
# from actions.csv).
# Run under X with --pipe; pass --logdir so the log lands in a temp dir:
#   DISPLAY=:0 ./src/xschem --pipe -q --logdir $(mktemp -d) \
#       --script tests/headless/test_action_log_dispatch.tcl
