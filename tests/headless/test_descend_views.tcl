# Phase 4 (library-manager) — descend & symbol<->schematic association by view.
# Descending into an instance must open the cell's SCHEMATIC VIEW
# (<lib>/<cell>/schematic/<cell>.sch), not the legacy ".sch next to the symbol"
# location (which for the new layout would wrongly be <cell>/symbol/<cell>.sch).
#   D1  descend a lib-qualified subcircuit -> its schematic view
#   D2  an instance 'schematic=<lib/other>' override -> other's schematic view
#   D3  a legacy flat subcircuit still descends to the flat <cell>.sch (compat)
#
# Run under X with --pipe from src/:
#   DISPLAY=:0 ./xschem --pipe -q --script ../tests/headless/test_descend_views.tcl
