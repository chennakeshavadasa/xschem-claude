# B2: autosave hooked into the edit funnel (set_modify).
# Spec: specs/descend_hierarchy_in_memory.md
#
# A genuine edit (set_modify(1)) immediately writes cellName~.sch; a real save
# removes it; loading and highlighting do NOT touch it. Works in a /tmp copy so a
# real save never overwrites a committed fixture.
#
# Run: src/xschem --nogui --pipe -q --nolog --script tests/headless/test_autosave_hook.tcl
