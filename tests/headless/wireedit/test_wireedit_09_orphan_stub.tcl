# TC9 (R12, Phase 5) — move-orphaned dangling stub removed. Reproduces the bad2-style
# residue: a moved component (res.sym R18 at 1360,-900; pin M=(1360,-870)) whose pin M
# is already served by the horizontal rail (1270,-870)-(1360,-870) ALSO carries a
# redundant vertical stub (1360,-870)-(1360,-900) whose far end (1360,-900) hangs on
# nothing. The release-time move-scoped cleanup drops that stub (it changes no
# connectivity: pin M stays connected through the rail), while the rail and the riser
# (anchored at the OUTI label) are preserved. Per the plan (option A) the fixture
# builds the residue then performs a stretch move so the in-gesture cleanup fires.
