# P2: make_symbol_dialog orchestrator (adaptive View-name / Create / Replace).
# Spec: specs/create_symbol_view.md
#
# Run TRUE HEADLESS from the repo root:
#   src/xschem --nogui --pipe -q --nolog --script tests/headless/test_make_symbol_dialog.tcl
#
# The GUI dialog (ask_symbol_view) is has_x-gated; here it is STUBBED to script the
# user's {view action} choice, and we assert the orchestrator routes to the right
# generation at the right view path. Modify is P3; the open-in-new-window step is
# has_x-gated (skipped headless).
