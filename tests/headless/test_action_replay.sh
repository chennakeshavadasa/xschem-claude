# Acceptance smoke for the action log (spec section 5 "the real one"):
# RECORD -> REPLAY -> DIFF across TWO processes.
#
#   1. process A loads a fixture, is driven through bound input actions (via
#      `xschem callback`, the real dispatch path that logs), and snapshots its
#      state. Its Xschem.log is captured.
#   2. process B loads the SAME fixture FRESH, `source`s A's log, and snapshots.
#   3. the two snapshots must be identical -> the log faithfully reproduces the
#      session.
#
# This proves the log is actually REPLAYABLE, not merely well-formed -- the one
# thing a single-process check cannot show.
#
# Needs a display (drives the canvas); run e.g. DISPLAY=:0 sh test_action_replay.sh
#
# What is diffed, and why a zoom RATIO not absolute zoom: the logged view
# commands reproduce the relative zoom TRANSFORM (xctx->zoom /= factor is pure)
# but not the absolute view. Absolute zoom depends on the post-load baseline,
# which depends on the drawing-area size at load time -- and that varies between
# two processes (window mapping is nondeterministic under WSLg, issues 0001/0002).
# The log is not meant to reproduce the absolute view anyway: wheel zoom centers
# on the mouse (view_zoom reads mousex_snap) and `xschem zoom_in` does not capture
# the pointer, so origin cannot round-trip either (a v1 limit, kin to the
# click-select gap, issue 0005). So the snapshot diffs the geometry-INDEPENDENT
# state the log IS designed to reproduce: the zoom transform (final/baseline),
# the colorscheme flag, and the object counts.

# --- RECORD driver -----------------------------------------------------------
# Layer C gestures: only the selection-INDEPENDENT ones belong here (wire/rect
# placement, symbol drop). A move/copy drop replays onto the then-current
# selection and the driver's `xschem select` is a script call that is NOT
# logged (issue 0005), so it cannot round-trip across processes. The zoom-drag
# gesture is also excluded: it logs an ABSOLUTE `xschem zoom_box`, whose
# resulting zoom depends on the drawing-area size (varies between processes,
# issues 0001/0002) -- its exact-view replay is proven in-process by
# test_gesture_end_log.tcl. Object state fidelity is diffed via the saved
# schematic below, which is geometry-independent.
