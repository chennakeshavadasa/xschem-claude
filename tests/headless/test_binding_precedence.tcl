# Phase 3c (c2): proves the binding-table dispatch is CONTEXT-AWARE with
# most-specific-wins precedence: an exact-context row beats a context-independent
# (global) row, and a global row is the fallback when no specific row exists.
# Tested with canvas-context events only (no graph fixture needed); the
# over_graph context is exercised later (c3/c6) once graph routing is migrated.
# Run under X with --pipe:
#   DISPLAY=:0 ./src/xschem --pipe --script tests/headless/test_binding_precedence.tcl
