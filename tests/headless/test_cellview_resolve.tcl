# Phase 2 (library-manager) — lib/cell/view resolver, the core.
# Teaches reference resolution the new layout WITHOUT breaking the old:
#   xschem cellview_path <lib/cell> <view>  -> abs datafile path or ""
#   abs_sym_path: rule 1 (abs/url) -> rule 2 (lib-qualified, new layout)
#                 -> rule 3 (legacy flat search, unchanged)
#   rel_sym_path: a SYMBOL-view path inside a registered library -> "lib/cell";
#                 everything else falls back to the legacy prefix stripping.
# A lib-qualified reference is "lib/cell" with the view inferred from context
# (symbol to instantiate, schematic via the .sch extension); a registered
# library resolves to <libpath>/<cell>/<view>/<cell>.<ext>.
#
# Run under X with --pipe from src/:
#   DISPLAY=:0 ./xschem --pipe -q --script ../tests/headless/test_cellview_resolve.tcl
