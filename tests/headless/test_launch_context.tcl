# Launch-context smoke (issue 0001). DELIBERATELY NON-HERMETIC: unlike the
# rest of this suite it runs against the REAL user environment (~/.xschem
# geometry/config) and the user's actual launch recipe, because issue 0001
# was invisible to every hermetic layer — a poisoned per-filename entry in
# ~/.xschem/geometry opened a 1x1 window only when launching from the repo
# root, while all sandboxed tests stayed green. This asserts the invariants
# that must hold in ANY healthy launch context:
#   (1) the main window comes up at a usable size,
#   (2) sourcing src/cadence_style_rc post-init (the --script recipe,
#       `src/xschem --script src/cadence_style_rc`) succeeds,
#   (3) its `xschem bind wheel ...` remaps actually land in the C table.
# Run under X with --pipe (any cwd):
#   DISPLAY=:0 ./src/xschem --pipe --script tests/headless/test_launch_context.tcl
