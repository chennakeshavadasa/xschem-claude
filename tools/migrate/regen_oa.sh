# Regenerate the lib/cell/view tree (xschem_libraries_oa/) from the flat
# xschem_library/ libraries. Non-destructive: rebuilds only the generated tree;
# the flat source is never touched. The library order below is the reference
# search order (a bare ref resolves to the first library that defines the cell).
#
# Migrated set = the standard cell/design libraries. Intentionally excluded
# (they rely on mechanisms that do not map cleanly to cell/view and keep working
# from the flat tree): generators (on-the-fly .tcl symbol generation),
# inst_sch_select (instance schematic-selection + absolute .cir includes),
# gschem_import (nested sym/ subdir), viewdraw_import (converter tool), symgen
# (.symdef sources).
#
# Run from anywhere; paths are resolved relative to this script.
